                Welcome.<br><br>
    
    This is the official website of the Estate of Gustav Elijah Ahr, who came to be known by his fans as “Lil Peep.”
    <br><br>
    This website is run by Gus’s mom and brother.
    <br><br>
    I have learned from Peep fans that Gus was a powerful and influential lyricist and music artist. It was Gus’s honesty that compelled so many people, worldwide, to connect with him. Gus was particularly observant, and able to express his observations clearly and poetically.
    <br><br>
    So, to honor him, we created this website. We felt that Gus’s fans—both current and future, would welcome the chance to get to know him a little better. We believe that you are right about Gus. You connected with him because he told you that he was like you, and he expressed feelings like the ones you have.
    <br><br>
    Yes. We wanted to make beautiful designs and things for people wear, skate on, and generally “flex” to show their support for Gus. But we also added an archive that we will add to regularly so visitors to our site can see some of Gus’s artifacts to get to know him better, as a person.
    <br><br>
    Thank you for visiting.
    <br>
    Liza

                <p class="date">Aug 15, 2022</p>
                <p class="desc">So, as a little kid, Gus got to experience the pleasure of writing freely. I have all of his written work from the first grade, as well as his early writing from Pre-K and Kindergarten.  It is interesting to analyze Gus’s early written work with all his other writing to think about as well.  I see patterns in his writing.  From the moment he began writing, as a child, until the day he died, Gus mixed reality with make-believe to express his feelings whether they were playful or sad.
                    What stands out the most to me when I read Gus’s early stories is how so many of them are evocative in the same way that his lyrics are.</p>

                <p class="date">Jul 11, 2022</p>
                <p class="desc">Gus was born in Allentown, Pennsylvania. We lived at 2625 Liberty St. which was right across the street from Muhlenberg College where Gus’s father worked. The house was owned by the College. The rent was cheap because we contracted to entertain students monthly with a movie night and discussion.
                    We had one car. It was a 1992 Nissan Sentra that my mother had bought for us brand new. Johan could walk to work, while I had the car for errands and the kids.</p>

                <p class="desc">This is written to set the record straight.  The Wikipedia page sites interviews.  Unfortunately--for the record--not all of Gus's published interviews were historically accurate.  He did not complete high school on-line.  He completed a semester of college on-line.  This entry is to set the record straight about his schooling.  There will be other posts to set the record straight about other inaccurately detailed parts of Gus's life. Perhaps the Wikipedia authors will read this.</p>

                    <span class = "sdesc">From July 27 to August 10, Gus and Makonnen had completed the first fifteen of what would be twenty-one songs and would later be known as the “Diamonds” project.  They had completed these songs in Los Angeles.  Makonnen had invited Gus, Smokeasac, Fish Narc, and Yung One Era to the Electric Feel studio on Sunset Boulevard.  The studio had been new to Gus, and the music was a very new style for him to “hop on.”  He had loved every minute of it.</span>

                    <span class = "sdesc">We know that Gus deleted the garage band (original) versions of many of his first songs, so for those songs all we have are the bounces. As he developed fluency with the equipment and his process, he “bounced” a song pretty much as soon as he composed it. But, in the beginning, he likely did not. We know this because we can hear him playing a song on his iPhone fully one month before our first documented record of the song on his computer—the “bounce.”</span>

The next day, Gus dropped crybaby.  Gus’s living situation plans fell through.  So, he stayed for a while with a friend named Elias.  Gus was busy trying to make music with a multitude of collaborators while he was staying at Elias’s house.</span>

Hellboy is a gritty, raw, and very intense piece of work in which Gus expresses feelings of anger, sorrow, loneliness, and determination.  It is passionate.  It is daring. And it kicks.  It showcases Gus’s love for the guitar.  The songs Gus chose to make Hellboy arose from his work with a small group of producers. These young men sampled some great, classic guitar riffs and combined them with the signature 808s for Gus to lay his vocal on and really wobble your rear view mirror.</span>

Now, nearly two years later, Lederrick and Yung Goth were there, too, as were several other young men. The place was full of people and creative energy. During all that time, Gus began to make the tracks for the Crybaby mixtape.</span>
